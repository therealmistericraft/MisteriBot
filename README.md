# MisteriBot
The MisteriBot is a Discord Bot, actually designed only to work on my Server, but I want to change this.

My native language is german and I think I wrote german too, I hope I can fix it so you can understand it too.

## Branches and Releases
There should be a branch for every version and for file updates like readme.md
The master branch should be the latest working piece of code, while the releases are complete versions the bot runs.
